# Scanpy scRNA-seq Analysis
this workflow modeled by Guidlines of [Scanpy Tutorial](https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html) which is inspired by [(Satija et al., 2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3192). Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing
single-cell gene expression data built jointly with anndata. It includes preprocessing, visualization, clustering, trajectory inference and differential expression 
testing.
